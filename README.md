# Kottoko

This repo is currently empty (temporarily). As of 03/28/2023 I have started restructuring my old (shameful) code. The backend of my new Kottoko will be in Laravel. I wanted my front end to be structured with Vue.JS or maybe even React or Next.JS and that still might be the plan but first I need to get over the hurdle that is learning Laravel in the first place. This note is here to say that progress is going great!
